# ROS Syllabus

The objective of the UR labs is to get students familiar with collaborative and industrial robot manipulators. The idea is to give a grasp of how to program them and solve simple tasks.

The objectives of the ROS teaching are that students get experience with programming, modelling, simulating and controlling both mobile robots and robot manipulators with ROS. The skills learned will also be used as part of a semester project on designing a robotic system for a real-world challenge.
