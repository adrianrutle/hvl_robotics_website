2. Make an account (free) and complete all the core and pro exercisesbefore your first lab

We have an UR5e and an older UR5 CB2.1 (upgraded CB in 2019). This meansthat the e-series exercises will fit perfectly, but the CB3 exerciseswill have a mismatch with CB2.1. The mismatch is not too big.

Take care to consider if you will be spending time on the UR5e or UR5,and prioritize which exercises to take. Every single one of them isrecommended.
