# Basics of UR {#Basics-of-UR}

## Theme

1. Waypoints.
2. Motion -- MoveJ og MoveL.
3. End-effector -- use of gripper.
4. Pick and place.

## Equipment

1. UR5 / UR5e robot with PolyScope (they are different, old/new).
2. Robotiq 2-Finger Adaptive Robot Gripper / Hand-E Gripper
3. Lab station with two boxes, two cups and a gripable object.

## Before the lab

1. Complete the [Universal Robots Academy](./UR_exercises.html)**\*\<\-- this is very important!**\*
2. If first time then contact lab-assistant/phd-fellow/teacher. Expectthorough follow up.
3. Travel to the [HVL RoboticsLab](https://www.google.com/maps/place/HVL+Robotics+Lab/@61.4590375,5.8326453,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4616333d5f3d88b5:0x2025abbba16257dd!8m2!3d61.459035!4d5.8348393)
4. Read and sign the lab rules.
5. Have all the fun with robots! If stuck then ask for help.

## Report

There is no need to hand in a report after this lab.

Signed attendance will suffice as approved lab exercise.

## Tasks

1. Repeat Universal Robots Academy Task 4. Creating a program, but thistime on a real robot.
    1. Make a triangle using MoveJ, then using MoveL, and finallyusing MoveP.
    2. Pick up a real box, place it somewhere else.
2. Repeat Universal Robots Academy Task 10. You may find it in the *PROTrack* section of the Universal Robots Academy - not in the *Core*section. The task is named feature coordinates. This time you willcompute the task on a real robot and you decide the real/imaginarybox.
  

## Race pace

Finally! A challenge. A series of demands are listed below, make aprogram to fulfill them. Make your program both as fast and smooth aspossible. This is a contest!

1. Build the course in the picture below.
2. Place the object in box C.
3. Make the start position for the robot straight up, pointing to thesky.
4. Pick up the object
5. Move between the two cups B, not over!
6. Place object in box A
