## Theme

1. Waypoints.
2. Motion -- MoveJ og MoveL.
3. End-effector -- using the gripper.
4. Pick and place.

## Equipment

1. UR5e-series robot with PolyScope.
2. Robotiq 2-Finger Adaptive Robot Gripper / Hand-E Gripper
3. Lab station with two boxes, two cups and a gripable object.

## Before the lab

1. **Very important:** Complete the [Universal Robots Academy](https://academy.universal-robots.com/free-e-learning/e-series-e-learning/){: .notice--warning}
2. Get in touch with the lab engineer **Raquel** (raquel.motzfeldt.tirach@hvl.no) for a good follow up.
3. Travel to Campus Verftet!
4. Read and sign the lab rules.
5. Have fun! If you are stuck don't hesitate to ask for help ðŸŒˆ

## Report

There is no need to hand in a report after this lab.
Signed attendance will suffice as approved lab exercise.

## Tasks

1. Repeat Universal Robots Academy Task 4. Creating a program, but this time on a **real robot**.
    1. Make a triangle using MoveJ, then using MoveL, and finally using MoveP. 
    2. Pick up a box with the robot, then place it somewhere else.
2. Repeat Universal Robots Academy Task 10. You may find it in the **PROTrack** section of the Universal Robots Academy - not in the **Core** section. The task is named feature coordinates. This time you will compute the task on a **real robot** and you decide the real/imaginary box.
  

## Race pace

Finally! A challenge. ðŸ¤–ðŸ”§

A series of requirements are listed below, make a program to fulfill them. 

Make the movements as fast and as smooth as possible!
