ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, Future Roboticists!

Welcome to the lab sessions, where your imagination meets real-world tech! ðŸš€ Remember that inverse Brainenberg vehicle you rocked in the virtual realm? It's time to see it cruise in real life using the TurtleBot 3 robot.

Our maze is set, your vehicle awaits. Get ready to fine-tune those algorithms and parameters, transforming your virtual success into real-world magic. ðŸŒŸ

Get set to witness the future unfold, one twisty maze and one parameter tweak at a time. ðŸ¤–ðŸ”§ðŸŒˆ
