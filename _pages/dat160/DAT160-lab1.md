👋 Hey there, Future Roboticists!

Welcome to the lab sessions, where your imagination meets real-world tech! 🚀 Remember that inverse Brainenberg vehicle you rocked in the virtual realm? It's time to see it cruise in real life using the TurtleBot 3 robot.

Our maze is set, your vehicle awaits. Get ready to fine-tune those algorithms and parameters, transforming your virtual success into real-world magic. 🌟

Get set to witness the future unfold, one twisty maze and one parameter tweak at a time. 🤖🔧

## Equipment
1. Your personal PC with the Virtual Machine running
2. Your code from Assignment 1
3. A real life Turtlebot 3
4. Good mood!🌈

## Before the lab 
1. Make sure you did Assigment 1
2. Get together in a group of 2-3 people
3. Find your way to Verftet, Øyrane

## Report 
There is no need to hand in a report for this lab. Signed attendance and a **cool video** of the final product will suffice as approved lab exercise. 

## Instructions

### Setting up the Virtual Machine Network
1. Select your virtual machine on the left bar
2. Click Edit virtual machine settings
3. Select Network Adapter
4. Select the first option **Bridged: Connected directly to the physical network** also check the **Replicate physical network connection state**
5. Go to Configure Adapters and ONLY select the wireless adapter which your PC has. In our case it is “Killer(R) Wi-Fi 6 AX1650 160MHz Wireless Network Adapter”
6. Save everything and start your virtual machine.

TO DO!! write this better with pictures and stuff!

- turn on the vm with the bridged network
- turn on the TB
- in the vm go to the baschrc filer and change the 30 to something else
- then ssh into the turtlebot, change said number too 
- then launch the bringup
- then on the vm launcht he python script and have fun changing the parameters to get the tb through the maze , open the python code with "code gile_name.py"

ops: 
from rclpy.qos import qos_profile_sensor_data
self.scan_sub = self.create_subscription(LaserScan, '/scan', self.clbk_laser, qos_profile_sensor_data)

parameters that worked for me: 
angles: 40 and 320
linear speed 0.1
lidar_threshold: 0.35
angular speed 0.45
